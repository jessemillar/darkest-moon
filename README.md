## Overview
Darkest Moon is an arcade-style game where the goal is to get the highest score possible before inevitably succumbing to the relentless progression of the game. The player controls a nameless farmer in the Dark Ages whose only goal in life is to plant and harvest wheat in order to survive and make it to the next day. An average play session lasts between five and fifteen minutes before the marauder becomes too fast and overtakes the player.

I made this game as the final project for a creativity class when I was still in college.
